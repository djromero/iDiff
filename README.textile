Simple image difference calculation based on "GTM":http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/ unit testing utilities.

Usage:
iDiff [-d] image_A image_B
 -d will write the diff image to disk in image_A directory
 
Exit status will be 0 if both images are identical.
When @-d@ flag is used the image with the difference will be saved to image_A directory.
